# TwitterFeedApp
Small Android app that searches for tweets based on provided hashtag. Uses twitter4j.

Download the code and open the TwitterFeed project in Android Studio.

Run the app module either on an emulator or on an Android device from Android Studio to get going!

There should be no other setup required :)
