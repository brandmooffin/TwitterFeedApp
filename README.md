# TwitterFeedApp
Small Android app that searches for tweets based on provided hashtag. Uses twitter4j.

Download the code and open the TwitterFeed project in Android Studio.

Run the app module either on an emulator or on an Android device from Android Studio to get going!

There should be no other setup required :)


Using the app:
- Load up the app on an Android device
- Enter a search keyword (with or without the '#', the app checks if it's included and will add it if needed)
- Default refresh rate is every 10 seconds, but feel free to adjust the time up to 60 seconds. (If you would like a different refresh rate, then feel free to add the option on the code and re-run through Android Studio :) )
- Once you have entered a hashtag term and the app has refreshed you should see a list of tweets based on the provided hashtag with wonderful images of the user that posted the tweet and any image if there is one provided.
- Enjoy :)
